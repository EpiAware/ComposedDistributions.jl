# The composer node/leaf extension contract: a new node implements
# `child_nleaves` / `child_logpdf` / `child_rand!`, and a new leaf wrapper
# `free_leaf` / `rewrap_leaf`. `component_names` reads a node's child names.

# The composer abstract-type hierarchy. `AbstractComposedDistribution` is the
# root the composer nodes subtype; `AbstractMultiChild` groups the positional
# multi-child composers (`Sequential` / `Parallel`); `AbstractOneOf` is the
# univariate one_of arm (`Resolve` / `Compete`). Downstream extension packages
# dispatch on these.
