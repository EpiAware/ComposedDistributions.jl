#
# A composer node combines branches into one flat event vector. The three

# `public.jl`) and documented in `docs/src/developer/extending.md`. They are
# reached by the qualified name (`ComposedDistributions.child_nleaves` etc.), as
# the leaf hooks `free_leaf` / `rewrap_leaf` are. The underscored aliases
# (`_child_nleaves` / `_child_logpdf` / `_child_rand!`) defined alongside each
# are retained for the package's existing internal callers, so dropping the
# underscore is source-compatible.
#
#   - `child_nleaves(node)`: how many flat slots the node occupies.
#   - `child_logpdf(node, x, offset, n)`: the node's contribution to the joint
#     log density, scoring the `n`-wide slice `x[offset + 1 : offset + n]`.
#   - `child_rand!(out, offset, rng, node)`: draw the node into the same slice.
#
# A node walks the flat vector by the same offset arithmetic the composer uses:
# `child_nleaves` gives the slice width, `child_logpdf` / `child_rand!` read and
# write `x[offset + 1 : offset + n]`. Composing two nodes is concatenation, so a
# nested node recurses by passing the same `(x, offset, n)` inward.
