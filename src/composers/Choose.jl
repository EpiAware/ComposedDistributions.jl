A data-selected disjunction over independent named alternatives.

`Choose` holds ``n`` NAMED alternatives ``D_1, \dots, D_n``, each an independent
sub-distribution, and a `selector` naming the DATA field that picks which
alternative applies to a record. Exactly one alternative is active per record,
chosen by the selector value, NOT by a branch probability and NOT off a shared
origin. This is the disjunctive split that neither [`Parallel`](@ref) (shared
origin, product over branches) nor [`Resolve`](@ref) (shared origin,
probabilistic mixture) expresses: the alternatives are genuinely independent
sub-models with different origins, and the data says which one generated the
record.

Scoring, sampling, and model dispatch all route to the SELECTED alternative.
`logpdf(d, x; kind)` and `rand(d; kind)` take the chosen name as the `kind`
keyword; there is no default, so the caller MUST supply one (a `Choose` has no
single distribution to score or sample without a selection). The selection walk
is type-stable: the selected alternative is found by a hand-rolled recursion
over the name tuple that barriers into the chosen alternative's concrete type,
so inference of the hot-path `logpdf` is preserved.

An alternative may itself be any distribution or a nested composer
([`Sequential`](@ref), [`Parallel`](@ref), [`Resolve`](@ref), or another
`Choose`), so a composed tree nests INSIDE a data-selected split. A `Choose`
may ALSO nest the other way, as a child of a `Sequential` / `Parallel` /
[`compose`](@ref) composer: the flat, data-free value path (`logpdf`/`rand`
without a `kind`) commits to its FIRST alternative, so the node's flat width is
that alternative's leaf count; every alternative must share that leaf count for
the nested `Choose` to occupy one fixed flat slot, or the parent's width query
errors.

For prior introspection ([`params_table`](@ref), [`build_priors`](@ref),
[`update`](@ref)) the alternatives' parameters are namespaced per alternative:
independent per-branch params live under their alternative name (`index.…` /
`sourced.…`), so each branch's parameters are inventoried and sampled separately.
A parameter tied across alternatives via [`shared`](@ref)`(:tag, ...)` is keyed
once by its `tag` and is inventoried once and sampled once, so the tied value is
shared by every alternative that uses it.

# Fields
- `names`: tuple of the alternative names (`Symbol`s).
- `alternatives`: tuple of the alternative distributions, one per name.
- `selector`: the row field name (`Symbol`) whose value selects an alternative.

Build a [`Choose`](@ref) data-selected disjunction from `name => dist`
alternatives.

Each alternative is `name => dist`: the alternative name (a `Symbol`) and its
independent sub-distribution. The `selector` keyword names the DATA field a
record carries to pick an alternative (default `:kind`). At least two
alternatives are required and their names must be unique.

# Arguments
- `alternatives`: the `name => dist` pairs, each an independent sub-distribution
  (a `UnivariateDistribution` or a nested composer).

# Keyword Arguments
- `selector`: the row field name (`Symbol`) whose value picks an alternative
  (default `:kind`).

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

# An index case (a short delay) vs a sourced case (a longer coupled delay),
# selected by the row's `:kind` field.
d = choose(:index => Gamma(2.0, 1.0),
    :sourced => Gamma(4.0, 1.5))

# Score the alternative the data names.
logpdf(d, 3.0; kind = :index)
```

Log probability density of the SELECTED alternative at `x`.

`Choose` is a data-selected disjunction, so scoring requires naming the active
alternative through the `kind` keyword; there is no default. The selection walk
is type-stable and the score is the selected alternative's own `logpdf`.

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

d = choose(:short => Gamma(2.0, 1.0), :long => Gamma(5.0, 1.0))
logpdf(d, 3.0; kind = :short)
```

# Both route through the type-stable `_pick`. Typing `x` keeps these methods

# batch methods (the Aqua ambiguity check), since a `Choose`'s active dimension
# is the selected alternative's, not fixed.

Sample the SELECTED alternative.

With a `kind` the draw is that alternative's own `rand` (a full named event
record if the alternative is a composed tree). WITHOUT a `kind` — the
forward-simulation path, where no data names the branch — an alternative is
sampled uniformly and its draw returned, so `rand` produces a full path for a
`Choose` top with no manual selection.
