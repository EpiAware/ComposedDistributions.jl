# --- AbstractOneOf: the shared supertype for the one_of-outcome composers ---
@doc raw"

Shared supertype of the one_of-outcome composers.

The two one_of-outcome nodes — the fixed-probability mixture [`Resolve`](@ref)
(cause and timing independent) and the racing-hazard [`Compete`](@ref) (the
winning probability derived from the hazards, timing coupled) — subtype
`AbstractOneOf`. The tree walkers dispatch on it wherever the behaviour is shared
(one event slot per outcome, the shared origin, the per-outcome `rand`) and on
the concrete type only where the scoring arithmetic differs.

`AbstractOneOf` is the univariate arm of the composer hierarchy: it subtypes
[`AbstractComposedDistribution`](@ref)`{Univariate, Continuous}`, so it stays a
`UnivariateDistribution` while sharing the composed supertype the multivariate
`Sequential` / `Parallel` / `Choose` also sit under.

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

r = resolve(:death => (Gamma(1.5, 1.0), 0.3), :disch => Gamma(2.0, 1.5))
r isa ComposedDistributions.AbstractOneOf
```

Marker distribution for a NO-EVENT (absorbing) outcome of a [`resolve`](@ref)
node: the outcome where *nothing happens* and no event time is written.

A `none => (NoEvent(), q)` branch carries no delay; its mass `q` is the
probability that no event occurs. On `rand` a no-event win yields `missing` (no
time recorded). On `logpdf` an OBSERVED non-occurrence (an explicit `no event by
the horizon` record) scores the survival term `log q` (mixture) or the
racing-hazard survival `∏ S_k`; a latent non-occurrence (a record whose no-event
slot is simply missing) contributes no one_of term.

`NoEvent` is a degenerate placeholder, not a sampling distribution: it has no
support and errors if asked for a density or a draw. It exists only to MARK the
absorbing branch so the one_of node carries its mass `q`.

Resolve outcomes composed from any univariate distributions: exactly one of
several outcomes occurs, governed by branch probabilities summing to one.

`Resolve` names each one_of outcome, its delay distribution, and the branch
probability of that outcome. It lowers to a `Distributions.MixtureModel`
(see [`as_mixture`](@ref)) over the outcome delays weighted by the branch
probabilities, so the realisation is a single time and the type is univariate.
A death-versus-recovery competition makes the death branch probability the
case-fatality ratio.

Being univariate, a `Resolve` nests as a child of [`Sequential`](@ref) or
[`Parallel`](@ref). This is the plain generic composition; per-record outcome
selection and censoring are not part of this type.

# Fields
- `names`: tuple of the one_of outcome names (`Symbol`s).

Build a fixed-probability [`Resolve`](@ref) node from
`name => (delay, branch_prob)` outcomes: exactly one outcome RESOLVES, with cause
independent of timing.

Each outcome is `name => (delay, branch_prob)`; the branch probabilities must
each lie in ``[0, 1]`` and sum to one, and at least two outcomes are required.

The LAST outcome's probability may be OMITTED (a bare `name => delay`): it then
takes the residual `1 - sum(of the others)`, so a probability that is fully
determined by the rest need not be written out (and cannot disagree with them).
The leading probabilities must sum to at most one. Omitting any outcome but the
last, or more than one, is rejected. To omit EVERY probability (a racing-hazard
node where the winning probability is derived from the hazards) use
[`compete`](@ref) instead.

# Arguments
- `outcomes`: two or more `name => (delay, branch_prob)` pairs, each giving the
  outcome name (a `Symbol`), its delay distribution, and the probability that
  the outcome occurs. The last pair's probability may be omitted (a bare
  `name => delay`), taking the residual `1 - sum(of the others)`.

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

cfr = 0.3
node = resolve(:death => (Gamma(1.5, 1.0), cfr),

Build a racing-hazard [`Compete`](@ref) node from bare `name => delay`
outcomes: the cause-specific delays RACE, the first wins, and the winning
probability of each cause is DERIVED from the hazards (cause coupled to timing).

Each outcome is `name => delay` (a bare delay, NO branch probability). At least
two outcomes are required. To give an explicit fixed probability per outcome (a
mixture where cause is independent of timing) use [`resolve`](@ref) instead.

# Arguments

Log probability density of the one_of-outcome marginal at `x`.

Routed through the AD-safe `_one_of_logmix` reduction rather than
`logpdf(as_mixture(c), x)`: `as_mixture` does `float.(branch_probs)`, which
strips an AD `Dual`/tracked type from the branch probabilities, breaking the
gradient w.r.t. a covariate case-fatality term (`logistic(Xβ)`) when a
`Resolve` is scored as a leaf of a plain (non-censored) `compose(...)` tree.
The explicit log-sum-exp keeps the probabilities' element type, so a `Dual`
propagates exactly as on the censored-tree scorer.

@doc "

Probability density of the one_of-outcome marginal at `x`.

`exp` of the AD-safe [`logpdf`](@ref), so branch-prob gradients survive (see the

@doc "

Cumulative distribution function of the one_of-outcome marginal at `x`.

The branch-prob-weighted mixture cdf `Σ_i p_i F_i(x)`, summed directly so the
probabilities keep their (possibly AD `Dual`) element type rather than being
stripped by `as_mixture`'s `float.(branch_probs)`. This keeps the cdf AD-safe on
a differentiated path (e.g. a censored-survival term), matching `logpdf`.

Base.rand(rng::AbstractRNG, c::Resolve) = rand(rng, as_mixture(c))
Base.rand(c::Resolve) = rand(default_rng(), c)

@doc "

Sample a one_of outcome AND its time, returning `(name, time)`.

Unlike the univariate [`rand`](@ref) (the marginal time-to-resolution, which
discards which outcome occurred), this draws the resolved outcome from the branch
probabilities and the time from that outcome's own delay, so the chosen outcome
is retained. Used by the full-path tree simulation, where a `Resolve` node
resolves to a single named outcome.

# Arguments
- `rng`: random number generator (the no-`rng` method uses the global default).
- `c`: the [`Resolve`](@ref) node to sample an outcome from.

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions, Random

node = Resolve(:death => (Gamma(1.5, 1.0), 0.3),
    :disch => (Gamma(2.0, 1.5), 0.7))
name, time = rand_outcome(MersenneTwister(1), node)
```

# Fixed-probability outcome probabilities (the Compete duals live in
# hazard_one_of.jl)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@doc "

The per-outcome probabilities of a fixed-probability [`Resolve`](@ref) node:
its declared branch probabilities (the no-event branch's mass is the
non-occurrence probability), returned as a `NamedTuple` keyed by the outcome
names.

This is the [`Resolve`](@ref) method of `Distributions.probs`, the standard
mixture-weight reader: a `Resolve` lowers to a `MixtureModel` (see
[`as_mixture`](@ref)), so its weights ARE the declared branch probabilities.
The racing-hazard [`Compete`](@ref) sibling derives the same split from the
hazards instead.

# Arguments
- `c`: the [`Resolve`](@ref) node whose declared branch probabilities to read.

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

node = resolve(:death => (Gamma(1.5, 1.0), 0.3),
    :disch => (Gamma(2.0, 1.5), 0.7))
probs(node)

[`Resolve`](@ref) node: one minus the no-event branch mass.
