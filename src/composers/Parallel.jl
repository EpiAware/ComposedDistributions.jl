Independent branches composed from any univariate distributions.

`Parallel` places ``n`` branch distributions ``D_1, \dots, D_n`` off one origin,
with the realisation the vector of branch values ``[v_1, \dots, v_n]``. A branch
may itself be a [`Sequential`](@ref), [`Parallel`](@ref), [`Resolve`](@ref),
[`Compete`](@ref) or [`Choose`](@ref) composer, so trees nest recursively and
the nesting is the tree.

`logpdf` is the sum of the per-branch log-densities,

```math
\log f(v_1, \dots, v_n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log f_{D_i}(v_i).
```

The branches are independent here: this is the plain generic composition. The
shared-origin coupling (where every branch shares one latent primary event) is a
censored specialisation layered on top elsewhere, not part of this type.

# Fields
- `components`: tuple of the branch distributions (each univariate or a nested
  composer).
- `names`: tuple of the branch names (`Symbol`s), one per component; the
  `compose` front-ends thread the user's names through, positional construction
  assigns `:branch_1, :branch_2, ...`.

@doc "

Compose univariate distributions into [`Parallel`](@ref) branches.

Each argument is a branch distribution; the realisation is the vector of branch
values. Pass branches as positional arguments or a single vector/tuple. Any
[`Sequential`](@ref), [`Resolve`](@ref), [`Compete`](@ref) or [`Choose`](@ref)
child nests.

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

d = Parallel(Gamma(2.0, 1.0), LogNormal(1.0, 0.5))
rand(d)
```

Parallel(c1, cs...) = Parallel((c1, cs...))
Parallel(components::AbstractVector) = Parallel(Tuple(components))

@doc "

Compose univariate distributions into [`Parallel`](@ref) branches.

Lowercase verb mirroring [`sequential`](@ref) / [`resolve`](@ref): the public
constructor for a [`Parallel`](@ref) branch set. Pass branch distributions
positionally (default names `:branch_1, :branch_2, ...`) or `name => dist` pairs
to name the branches; a branch may itself be a [`Sequential`](@ref),
[`Resolve`](@ref), [`Compete`](@ref), [`Choose`](@ref) or nested set. Prefer
this verb over the bare struct constructor.

# Arguments
- `branches`: the branch distributions, either as positional distributions or as
  `name => dist` pairs naming each branch.

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

d = parallel(:admit => Gamma(2.0, 1.0), :notif => LogNormal(1.0, 0.5))
event_names(d)
```

Nested, name-keyed parameters of the branches.

Returns a `NamedTuple` keyed by the branch names, each value the `params` of that
branch (recursing into nested composers; a leaf delegates to its standard/
extended `Distributions.params`). This nested form is for prior introspection
via [`params_table`](@ref); a composed distribution reconstructs through
[`compose`](@ref), not through `Distribution(params...)`.

Sample a branch realisation as a `NamedTuple` keyed by the per-branch value
names: one entry per leaf branch, a nested
[`Sequential`](@ref)/[`Parallel`](@ref) branch contributing its own sub-values
under dotted-joined names, and a [`Resolve`](@ref) branch contributing its own
collapsed scalar.
