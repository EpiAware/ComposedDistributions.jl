A name-tagged leaf tied across the branches of a composed distribution.

`Shared` wraps a leaf distribution with a `tag` (a `Symbol`) marking it as a
shared parameter group. Two `Shared` leaves carrying the SAME tag are treated as
the SAME free parameter by the prior/params interface: [`params_table`](@ref)
lists the group's parameters ONCE (deduped by tag), a downstream
`composed_parameters_model` samples the group ONCE and places the sampled
values in every occurrence, and [`update`](@ref) updates all occurrences from one
entry. The wrapper is transparent to scoring and sampling (every distribution
method delegates to the wrapped leaf), so it only changes how parameters are
inventoried, sampled and reconstructed.

# Fields
- `tag`: the shared-parameter group name (`Symbol`).
- `dist`: the wrapped leaf distribution.

# See also
- [`shared`](@ref): constructor over a name and a distribution.
- [`params_table`](@ref), [`update`](@ref): dedup occurrences by tag.

Tag a leaf distribution as a shared parameter group named `name`.

`shared(name, dist)` marks `dist` as a tied parameter so multiple occurrences of
the same `name` in a composed distribution are handled ONCE by the prior/params
interface (inventoried, sampled and updated as a single free parameter), with the
shared value placed in every occurrence. The result is transparent to scoring and
sampling.

`shared(name, dist)` is the LEAF-LOCAL spelling of the tie, applied where the leaf
is built. [`tie`](@ref)`(d, paths...; name)` is the TREE-LEVEL spelling of the
SAME tie: it walks a composed `d` to the named leaves and wraps each in the exact
`shared(name, leaf)` artefact this produces. Use whichever is convenient; the
tagged occurrences are one free parameter either way.

# Arguments
- `name`: the shared-parameter group name (`Symbol`).
- `dist`: the leaf distribution to tag.

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

# The same incubation `inc` tied across two branches of a `choose`.
inc = shared(:inc, Gamma(2.0, 1.0))
d = choose(:index => inc,
    :sourced => compose((src = LogNormal(0.5, 0.4), inc = inc)))
event_names(d)
```

# placed, so a `tie`d tree and a hand-`shared`d tree are identical. The walk
# reuses `_edit_at` (the `intervene`/`update` path machinery); paths take the
# same forms `event`/`update` accept (a bare `Symbol`, a dotted-path `Symbol`
# like `:"sourced.inc"`, or a tuple of edge names).

# Normalise an `event`/`update` path form to a tuple of edge-name steps:
# a tuple stays as-is, a dotted `Symbol` (`:a.b`) splits, a bare `Symbol` is one

Tie leaves at named paths of a composed distribution into one shared group.

`tie(d, paths...; name)` walks the composed distribution `d` to each leaf named
by `paths` and wraps it in a [`Shared`](@ref) group tagged `name`, returning the
rebuilt composed distribution. This is the tree-level, path-based spelling of
[`shared`](@ref): `tie(d, p1, p2; name = :inc)` produces the EXACT same artefact
as building `d` with `shared(:inc, leaf)` at each of those leaves, so every tag
consumer ([`params_table`](@ref), [`build_priors`](@ref), [`update`](@ref), a
downstream `composed_parameters_model`) inventories, samples and updates the
tied leaves as a single free parameter.

Each `path` takes the SAME forms [`event`](@ref) and [`update`](@ref) accept: a
bare `Symbol` direct child, a dotted-path `Symbol` (`:\"sourced.inc\"`, as in
[`params_table`](@ref)'s `edge` column), or a tuple of edge names from the root.
Every path must resolve to a leaf (not a composer subtree), and the tied leaves
must be parameter-compatible (same inner family and parameter structure), since
they become one group.

# Arguments
- `d`: the composed distribution to tie leaves in.
- `paths`: one or more leaf paths to tie together.

# Keyword Arguments
- `name`: the shared-parameter group name (`Symbol`, required).

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

d = choose(:index => compose((inc = Gamma(2.0, 1.0),)),
    :sourced => compose((src = LogNormal(0.5, 0.4), inc = Gamma(2.0, 1.0))))
tied = tie(d, (:index, :inc), (:sourced, :inc); name = :inc)
params_table(tied)
