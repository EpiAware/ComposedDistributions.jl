# `compose` is a constructor over the [`Sequential`](@ref) / [`Parallel`](@ref)
# composers: it does not introduce a new monolithic tree type. Three
# friendly inputs all lower to the same nested composer stack:
#
# - a `NamedTuple` (named, recursive): a `Parallel` over the named children; a
#   child that is itself a `NamedTuple` nests as a `Parallel`, a child that is a
#   `Vector`/`Tuple` of distributions nests as a `Sequential`, a bare
#   distribution is a leaf;
# - a Tables.jl table with `name` and `dist` columns: a `Parallel` over the rows
#   (the column-table equivalent of a flat `NamedTuple`);
# - a nested `Matrix` of distributions: rows are `Parallel` branches and the
#   columns within a row are `Sequential` steps (a branching grid).
#
# The mappings are chosen so the three inputs build identical stacks for the
# same structure, which the tests assert by `==` on the composed objects.

@doc "

Build a nested composer stack from a friendly front-end input.

`compose` lowers a NamedTuple, a Tables.jl table, or a nested matrix to the same
[`Sequential`](@ref) / [`Parallel`](@ref) stack. It is a constructor over the
composers, not a new tree type.

# Arguments
- `input`: the front-end to lower, one of the three forms below.

# Inputs

- `NamedTuple` (named, recursive): a [`Parallel`](@ref) over the named children.
  A child that is itself a `NamedTuple` nests as a `Parallel`, a child that is a
  `Vector` or `Tuple` of distributions nests as a [`Sequential`](@ref), and a
  bare `UnivariateDistribution` is a leaf branch.
- Tables.jl table with `name` and `dist` columns: a [`Parallel`](@ref) over the
  rows, the column-table equivalent of a flat `NamedTuple`. An optional `chain`
  column folds rows sharing a non-zero group id into a [`Sequential`](@ref)
  branch, and an optional `compete`/`prob` column pair folds rows sharing a
  non-zero `compete` id into a [`Resolve`](@ref) node whose `prob` entries are
  the branch probabilities (each in ``[0, 1]`` and summing to one per group).
- nested `Matrix` of distributions: rows are [`Parallel`](@ref) branches and the
  columns within a row are [`Sequential`](@ref) steps. This orientation is
  canonical, so a one-column matrix is parallel leaf branches (one row each) and
  a one-row matrix is a single [`Sequential`](@ref) chain (the lone row's
  columns), not a `Parallel`.

# Contract

`compose` ALWAYS returns a composer, never a bare univariate leaf.
A single branch stays a [`Parallel`](@ref)-of-one and a single step a
one-element [`Sequential`](@ref); the wrapper is never collapsed away.
A bare leaf is used directly at the SCORING layer, where
[`record_distributions`](@ref) and [`composed_distribution_model`](@ref) accept
a bare `UnivariateDistribution`, so callers do not need `compose` to pass one
through.

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

# A regular 2x2 grid built three ways, all equal.
nt = (r1 = [Gamma(2.0, 1.0), LogNormal(0.5, 0.4)],
    r2 = [Gamma(1.0, 1.0), Gamma(3.0, 1.0)])
table = (name = [:a, :b, :c, :d],
    dist = [Gamma(2.0, 1.0), LogNormal(0.5, 0.4),
        Gamma(1.0, 1.0), Gamma(3.0, 1.0)],
    chain = [1, 1, 2, 2])
mat = [Gamma(2.0, 1.0) LogNormal(0.5, 0.4); Gamma(1.0, 1.0) Gamma(3.0, 1.0)]
compose(nt) == compose(table) == compose(mat)
```

# --- NamedTuple front-end --------------------------------------------------
# A NamedTuple maps to a Parallel over its values, each value lowered by
# `_compose_child`. The keys become the branch names, threaded into the
# `Parallel` so `params`/`params_table`/`show` are name-keyed (Option A).
# Structurally this still matches the table and matrix forms (`==` ignores
# names); only the labels differ.
#
# A column table is also a NamedTuple, so a NamedTuple carrying `name`/`dist`
# column vectors is routed to the Tables.jl path instead, letting one
# `(name, dist, chain)` column table build the same stack as a structural
# NamedTuple.

end

# --- shared-origin front-end ----------------------------------------------
# `compose(origin; branch = ...)` shares `origin` across the named branches: the
# branches fan out from one origin, so the result is a Sequential whose last step
# is a Parallel of the branch tails. Convolving the stack returns one series per
# branch, each delayed by `origin` convolved with the branch tail (e.g. a shared
# incubation, then a reporting branch and a death branch).

end

# A NamedTuple is treated as a column table when it has `name` and `dist`
# fields that are both vectors (the column-table shape), and those vectors
# carry the column roles of a real table: the `:dist` column holds
# distributions and the `:name` column holds row labels (not distributions).
# This disambiguates a genuine `(name, dist)` table from a structural
# NamedTuple whose user-chosen branch keys happen to be `:name`/`:dist`
# carrying distribution vectors, e.g. `(name = [d1, d2], dist = [d3, d4])` —
# two named chain branches, not a table.

# --- nested Matrix front-end -----------------------------------------------
# A matrix maps to a Parallel over its rows (branches), each row a Sequential
# over its columns (chain steps). A row with a single entry collapses to that
# bare leaf, so a one-column matrix is parallel leaf branches (one row each)
# and a one-row matrix is a single Sequential chain (the lone row's columns),
# matching the NamedTuple/table forms for the same structure.
#
# Names thread through optional keyword arguments (Option A): `names`
# labels the row branches and `step_names` labels the columns within each
# multi-step row. Both fall back to positional defaults (`:branch_i` /
# `:step_j`) when omitted, so the matrix form still works name-free.

# --- Tables.jl table front-end ---------------------------------------------
# A table with `name` and `dist` columns maps to a Parallel over its rows, the
# column-table equivalent of a flat NamedTuple of leaves. An optional `chain`
# column groups consecutive rows that share a non-zero group id into one
# Sequential branch, so a table can also express the nested chain a NamedTuple
# encodes with a vector value. An optional `compete`/`prob` column pair folds
# the rows sharing a non-zero `compete` group id into one `Resolve` node (the
# `prob` entries its branch probabilities), so the table can also express a
# one_of-outcome set. The generic method accepts any Tables.jl source (a
# column table is also matched by the NamedTuple method, which delegates here);
# the `_compose_table` worker does the shared build.
