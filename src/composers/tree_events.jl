    _flat_event_names(d)

The internal worker behind the public [`event_names`](@ref) (flat) accessor:
the tuple of event names matching the scored event vector
`[E_0, E_1, ..., E_k]`, the root origin event followed by one target event per
edge in depth-first order. Built by appending into a `Symbol[]` and freezing
to a tuple, mirroring the `params_table` pre-order walk; edge names are read
from the parent composer's `names` field (a leaf edge does not store its own
name), so each child is visited paired with its edge name.

Event names are derived from the composer's edge names (an edge
`:onset_admit` gives origin `:onset` and target `:admit`); an edge with a
positional default name (`:step_i` / `:branch_i`) contributes the positional
event name `:event_i` instead. These event names key a data row (a linelist
column is an event time), distinct from the edge names
([`component_names`](@ref) / the parameter inventory).
