Resolve risks by racing hazards: the dual of [`convolve_distributions`](@ref)
under MINIMUM instead of sum.

Given cause-specific delay distributions `D_1, ..., D_n`, `Compete`
represents the first-event time `T = min_k D_k` together with which cause won.
The marginal `any-event` survival is `∏_k S_k(t)` and density
`∑_j f_j(t) ∏_{k≠j} S_k(t)`, so it nests as a univariate leaf. Observing a
resolved `(cause j, time t)` scores `f_j(t) ∏_{k≠j} S_k(t)`. The winning
probability of each cause is DERIVED from the hazards
(`P(cause = j) = ∫ f_j ∏_{k≠j} S_k`), NOT a free parameter — this is the key
difference from the fixed-probability mixture [`Resolve`](@ref).

Build it with the [`compete`](@ref) constructor by giving BARE delays
(no branch probabilities): `compete(:death => D1, :recover => D2)`.

Three views must agree: [`rand`](@ref) draws a latent time per cause and
returns the argmin; [`logpdf`](@ref) is the one_of-risks likelihood (marginal
or cause-resolved); and the forward [`convolve_distributions`](@ref) stream is
the per-outcome sub-density, sub-stochastic (not renormalised). `Compete`
ships against plain `Distributions.ccdf`/`logccdf`, so any stock univariate
leaf races without a package-specific interface.

Build a racing-hazard [`Compete`](@ref) node from `name => delay`
outcomes (bare delays, NO branch probabilities).

Each outcome is `name => delay`. The winning probability of each cause is derived
from the hazards, so no branch probability is supplied (that is what selects this
type over the fixed-probability mixture [`Resolve`](@ref)). At least two
outcomes are required.

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

node = Compete(:death => Gamma(2.0, 3.0), :recover => Gamma(3.0, 2.0))
probs(node)

Sample a racing-hazard outcome AND its time, returning `(name, time)`: draw a
latent time per cause and return the `argmin` cause with its `min` time.

This is the generative dual of the [`logpdf`](@ref) (`f_j ∏_{k≠j} S_k`) and of
the forward `convolve_distributions` stream: the Monte Carlo winning-cause
frequencies match the derived `Distributions.probs` split and the forward
per-outcome stream masses.

# Arguments
- `rng`: random number generator (the no-`rng` method uses the global default).
- `c`: the [`Compete`](@ref) node to sample a winning cause from.

# Examples
```@example

node = compete(:death => Gamma(2.0, 3.0), :recover => Gamma(3.0, 2.0))
name, time = rand_outcome(MersenneTwister(1), node)

The DERIVED per-cause winning probabilities of a racing-hazard
[`Compete`](@ref) node: `P(cause = j) = ∫ f_j(t) ∏_{k≠j} S_k(t) dt`,
returned as a `NamedTuple` keyed by the outcome names.

This is the [`Compete`](@ref) method of `Distributions.probs`, the standard
mixture-weight reader: it gives the same per-outcome split [`Resolve`](@ref)
returns from its declared branch probabilities, but DERIVED here from the
hazards rather than declared.

Computed by AD-safe fixed-node Gauss-Legendre quadrature of the cause-resolved
sub-density over the marginal support. The probabilities are sub-stochastic-free
(they sum to one for proper, eventually-certain causes); a node whose causes can
leave residual survival at `+∞` (a defective cause) sums to less than one, the
deficit being the never-resolved mass.
