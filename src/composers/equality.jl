# so the NamedTuple, table, and matrix `compose` forms stay structurally `==`
# while each carries its own names. `==`/`hash` therefore compare only
# `components` for `Sequential`/`Parallel` (ignoring the `names` field); use
# `component_names` to compare names explicitly. `Resolve` keeps its names in
# `==`/`hash`, as those names are intrinsic outcome identities, not relaxable
# structure metadata.
