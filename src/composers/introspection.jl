# (primary event, truncation, interval) are fixed structure, not free
# parameters; only the inner delay's parameters (the `Gamma` shape/scale) are
# free. `_free_leaf` peels the fixed censoring off to the inner free delay, and
# `_rewrap_leaf` rebuilds the same censoring around a new inner delay. The
# introspection (`params_table`, names) and reconstruction layers go through
# these, so a censored leaf is transparent: its rows show only the inner free
# params and it round-trips by re-censoring the rebuilt delay. A plain leaf is
# the identity for both. The public `Distributions.params` is unchanged.

@doc raw"

Innermost free delay of a (possibly wrapped) leaf.

The base identity contract: a plain leaf is its own free leaf, and a `Truncated`
peels to its untruncated inner delay (the truncation bounds are fixed structure,
not free parameters). A wrapper type (censoring in CensoredDistributions, the
modifiers in ModifiedDistributions) adds its own method dispatching on its own
type, so a composed leaf is transparent to the prior/params interface. Pair with
[`rewrap_leaf`](@ref), which rebuilds the same wrapper around a new inner delay.

# Arguments
- `leaf`: the (possibly wrapped) leaf distribution to peel.

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

free_leaf(truncated(Gamma(2.0, 1.0); upper = 10.0))
```

# See also
- [`rewrap_leaf`](@ref): the inverse rebuild.
"
free_leaf(leaf) = leaf

@doc raw"

Rebuild the same wrapper around a new inner delay `inner`.

The inverse of [`free_leaf`](@ref): the base identity returns `inner`, and a
`Truncated` re-applies its bounds around the rebuilt inner delay. A wrapper type
adds its own method on its own type, so `rewrap_leaf(leaf, free_leaf_of_new)`
carries the fixed structure across a parameter update.

# Arguments
- `leaf`: the wrapped leaf whose fixed structure is re-applied.
- `inner`: the new inner delay to wrap.

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

rewrap_leaf(truncated(Gamma(2.0, 1.0); upper = 10.0), Gamma(3.0, 1.5))

Flatten a composed distribution's parameters into a prior-definition table.

`params_table(d)` returns a Tables.jl column table (a [`ParamsTable`](@ref)
wrapping a `NamedTuple` of equal-length column vectors, so
`Tables.istable(params_table(d))` is `true` and it prints as a padded table);
wrap it in `DataFrame` for a DataFrame. It has one row per scalar free parameter
of the composed distribution `d`, with columns:

- `edge`: the dotted path of names to the parameter's edge/leaf (e.g.
  `:onset_admit`, or `:resolution.branch_probs` inside a `Resolve`).
- `param`: the parameter name (e.g. `:mu`, `:sigma`; positional `:param_i` where
  the family is unmapped).
- `value`: the current parameter value.
- `support`: the `(minimum, maximum)` variate support of that edge's
  distribution, the domain a prior over the edge must respect (from `minimum`/
  `maximum`/`support`).
- `prior`: the attached prior of an [`uncertain`](@ref) parameter (its spec
  distribution), or `nothing` for a fixed parameter. [`build_priors`](@ref)
  uses a non-`nothing` entry ahead of its per-row default.

Define priors against the rows of this table instead of hand-matching parameter
names. Built from [`params`](@ref) (nested, name-keyed values) plus the edge
distributions' support.

For a [`Choose`](@ref) node the alternatives' independent per-branch params are
namespaced per alternative (`index.…` / `sourced.…`), one row-group per
alternative. A parameter tied across alternatives via [`shared`](@ref)`(:tag,
...)` is inventoried ONCE under its `tag` edge and sampled once, so a value tied
across the index and sourced branches appears as a single row-group.

Update a composed distribution's free parameters from a nested `NamedTuple`.

`update(d, params)` returns a new distribution of the SAME structure as `d` with
its free parameters replaced by the values in `params`. The `params` NamedTuple
mirrors the tree: a [`Sequential`](@ref)/[`Parallel`](@ref) is keyed by its edge
names, a leaf by its parameter names (as in [`params_table`](@ref)'s `param`
column), and a [`Resolve`](@ref) by its outcome names plus an optional
`branch_probs` entry. A censored leaf is transparent: supply only the inner
delay's parameters and the censoring is carried through.

Pair with `chain_to_params` (from a downstream Turing-fitting extension) to
read posterior means or a single draw from a fitted chain into the right
NamedTuple, so `update(template, means)` returns a ready-to-`rand`/inspect
distribution.

# Arguments
- `d`: the composed distribution (or bare leaf) to update.
- `params`: a nested NamedTuple of new parameter values keyed like `d`.

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

tree = compose((onset_admit = Gamma(2.0, 1.0),
    admit_death = LogNormal(0.5, 0.4)))
tree2 = update(tree, (onset_admit = (shape = 3.0, scale = 1.5),
    admit_death = (mu = 0.7, sigma = 0.5)))

Pick a default prior for a parameter row, brms-style.

`default_prior(row)` is the per-row default [`build_priors`](@ref) uses for rows
the user does not override. `row` is a `(; edge, param, value, support)`
NamedTuple (a [`params_table`](@ref) row); the prior family follows the
parameter's own natural domain (classified by name), not the leaf's variate
support:

- a probability parameter, support `[0, 1]` (a `branch_probs` row) ->
  `Uniform(0, 1)`.
- a scale/shape/rate-type parameter (`:sigma`, `:scale`, `:shape`, `:rate`, ...)
  -> `truncated(Normal(value, scale); lower = 0)`, positive by construction even
  for a location-family delay (a `Normal`/`Affine(Normal)` `sigma`).
- a location parameter (`:mu`, `:location`, a `Uniform` bound) ->
  `Normal(value, scale)`, unconstrained since the location lives on the whole
  line even for a positive-support delay.
- otherwise, an unmapped name falls back to the variate support: a non-negative
  support -> `truncated(Normal(value, scale); lower = 0)`, else
  `Normal(value, scale)`.

The spread `scale` defaults to `max(abs(value), 1)`, a weakly-informative width
that scales with the parameter's magnitude.

# Arguments
- `row`: a [`params_table`](@ref) row `(; edge, param, value, support)`.

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

# A positive scale parameter -> a positive-truncated default.
default_prior((; edge = :onset_admit, param = :scale,
    value = 1.0, support = (0.0, Inf)))
```

Assemble the nested prior `NamedTuple` from a [`params_table`](@ref) inventory.

`build_priors(table; priors, default)` turns the flat parameter table into the
nested `NamedTuple` that a downstream `composed_parameters_model` (and
[`update`](@ref)) expect, so users define priors against the flat table rows
rather than by hand-matching the tree.

For each row the prior is chosen in order:
1. a user `priors` override for that `(edge, param)`, if present, else
2. the row's attached `prior` (an [`uncertain`](@ref) parameter's spec rides
   the table's `prior` column), if present, else
3. `default(row)`, the per-row default (support-derived [`default_prior`](@ref)
   unless a different `default` function is given).

By default every row gets a sensible support-derived prior, so
`build_priors(params_table(tree))` alone yields a complete prior NamedTuple. A
user overrides only the parameters they care about (brms-style partial override)
through `priors`.

`row` is a `NamedTuple` `(; edge, param, value, support)` (the table's columns
for that row), so a custom `default` can pick a prior from the parameter's
`support`.

# Arguments
- `table`: a [`params_table`](@ref) inventory (any Tables.jl column table with
  `edge`, `param`, `value`, `support` columns).

# Keyword Arguments
- `priors`: per-parameter overrides, either a `(edge, param) => prior` mapping
  (e.g. a `Dict`) or a nested `NamedTuple` keyed like the tree
  (`(onset_admit = (shape = prior,),)`); only the listed parameters are
  overridden (default: empty).
- `default`: a function `row -> prior` for rows not overridden (default:
  [`default_prior`](@ref), deriving the prior family from the parameter's
  support).

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

tree = compose((onset_admit = Gamma(2.0, 1.0),
    admit_death = LogNormal(0.5, 0.4)))
tbl = params_table(tree)
# Support-derived defaults everywhere, overriding only one parameter.
nested = build_priors(tbl;
    priors = (onset_admit = (shape = truncated(Normal(2, 0.5); lower = 0),),))
nested.onset_admit.shape

The FLAT event names of a composed distribution.

`event_names(d)` returns the tuple of event names in flat depth-first order:
the root origin event followed by one target event per leaf edge.
An inner composer's events are exposed, so `compose((path = [a, b],))` lists the
inner `(:onset, ...)` events rather than just the `(:path,)` edge. Event names
are derived from the edge names (an edge `:onset_admit` gives origin `:onset` and
target `:admit`); a positional default edge contributes `:event_i`. These EVENT
names key a data ROW, distinct from the nested EDGE/child structure of
[`event_tree`](@ref) (whose first level is the top-level child names).

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

tree = compose((onset_admit = LogNormal(1.5, 0.4),
    admit_death = Gamma(2.0, 1.0)))
event_names(tree)

The NESTED tree of event names of a composed distribution.

`event_tree(d)` returns the event-name structure as data: a nested `NamedTuple`

the top-level child names (the old top-level `event_names` result); a

Fetch a composed distribution's child (event/edge), or descend a name path.

`event(d, path...)` returns the sub-distribution of `d` at the named location: a
single `Symbol` fetches a direct child (a branch of a [`Parallel`](@ref), a step
of a [`Sequential`](@ref), an outcome delay of a [`Resolve`](@ref), or an
alternative of a [`Choose`](@ref)); multiple `Symbol`s, or a single dotted-path
`Symbol` (`:admit_path.admit_death`, as in [`params_table`](@ref)'s `edge`
column), descend the tree one name per step. Throws a `KeyError` if a name along
the path is not a child at that level.

# Arguments
- `d`: the composed distribution to look up a child of (or descend into).

  or a single dotted-path `Symbol`.
