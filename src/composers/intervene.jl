# --- path-walk core ---------------------------------------------------------

"""
    _edit_at(node, path, op)

The path-walk core shared by [`update`](@ref), [`prune`](@ref) and
[`splice`](@ref): walks `path` from `node`, applying `op(target)` at the
addressed node and rebuilding the spine on the way back up. `path` is a tuple
of edge names, in the same forms [`event`](@ref) accepts. An empty path
applies `op` to `node` itself; otherwise `_edit_step` dispatches on the
composer type to find the named child, recurse, and rebuild with the edited
child swapped in.

# --- update: replace a node (structural edit) -------------------------------
#
# `update` is the single verb for both kinds of shape-preserving edit: a value
# update keyed by a nested NamedTuple (the `update(d, ::NamedTuple)` method in
# `introspection.jl`) and node replacement keyed by `path => new_node` pairs
# (here). The two methods dispatch on the second argument at the public
# boundary, so the type-stable scoring path (the NamedTuple worker `_update`) is
# untouched by the structural-edit path.

@doc "

Replace named nodes of a composed distribution with new distributions.

`update(d, path => new_node, ...)` returns a new composed distribution of the
SAME outer structure as `d` with the node addressed by each `path` replaced by
`new_node`. A `path` is a `Symbol` (a top-level child), a dotted `Symbol`
(`:admit_path.admit_resolution.death`, as in [`event`](@ref) /
[`params_table`](@ref)), or a tuple of edge names from the root (e.g.
`(:admit_path, :admit_resolution, :death)`); the same address [`event`](@ref)
READS is the one this WRITES. `new_node` may be a leaf distribution or a nested
composer. This shares the recursive reconstruction with the value-update method
[`update`](@ref)`(d, params::NamedTuple)`, so the result scores and `rand`s. It
preserves the tree SHAPE; for shape changes use [`prune`](@ref) or
[`splice`](@ref).

# Arguments
- `d`: the composed distribution to edit.
- `edits`: one or more `path => new_node` pairs.

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

tree = compose((onset_admit = Gamma(2.0, 1.0),
    admit_death = LogNormal(0.5, 0.4)))
tree2 = update(tree, :admit_death => Gamma(3.0, 1.5))
event(tree2, :admit_death)
```

# --- prune: drop a Resolve arm / Choose alternative / step ----------------

@doc "

Drop a branch from a composed distribution (a topology edit).

`prune(d, path)` removes the node addressed by `path` from its parent, CHANGING
the tree shape. A [`Resolve`](@ref) arm is removed and the remaining branch
probabilities are renormalised to sum to one; a [`Choose`](@ref) alternative or
a [`Sequential`](@ref)/[`Parallel`](@ref) step is removed. The parent must keep
at least the minimum number of children (two for `Resolve`/`Choose`, one for
`Sequential`/`Parallel`). The result is a valid composed distribution that
scores and `rand`s. `path` accepts the same forms as [`event`](@ref): varargs
`Symbol`s, a dotted `Symbol`, or a tuple of edge names.

`prune` and [`splice`](@ref) are the two topology edits (they change the tree
shape); [`update`](@ref) keeps the same shape and replaces contents.

# Arguments

- `path`: the branch to drop, as varargs `Symbol`s, a dotted `Symbol`, or a
  tuple of edge names.

# Examples
```@example

node = resolve(:death => (Gamma(1.5, 1.0), 0.3),
    :disch => (Gamma(2.0, 1.5), 0.5),

# --- splice: insert a before/after step at a node ---------------------------

@doc "

Splice before/after steps around a node in a composed distribution (a topology
edit).

`splice(d, path; before, after)` replaces the node at `path` with a
[`Sequential`](@ref) chain of `before`, the original node, then `after` (any of
which may be omitted). This inserts a change-point step around the addressed
node without rebuilding the rest of the tree, e.g. an extra delay before a
branch or a follow-up step after it, CHANGING the tree shape. The result is a
valid composed distribution that scores and `rand`s. `path` accepts the same
forms as [`event`](@ref): varargs `Symbol`s, a dotted `Symbol`, or a tuple of
edge names.

`splice` and [`prune`](@ref) are the two topology edits (they change the tree
shape); [`update`](@ref) keeps the same shape and replaces contents.

# Arguments
- `d`: the composed distribution to edit.
- `path`: the node to wrap, as varargs `Symbol`s, a dotted `Symbol`, or a tuple
  of edge names.

# Keyword Arguments
- `before`: a `name => dist` step inserted before the node (default: none).
- `after`: a `name => dist` step inserted after the node (default: none).

# Examples
```@example
using ComposedDistributions, Distributions

tree = compose((onset_admit = Gamma(2.0, 1.0),
    admit_death = LogNormal(0.5, 0.4)))
