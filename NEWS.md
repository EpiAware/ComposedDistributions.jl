## 0.1.0 — initial release

- The generic composition algebra ported from CensoredDistributions.jl:
  `compose` and the five composers (`Sequential`, `Parallel`, `Resolve`,
  `Compete`, `Choose`), `shared`/`tie`, structural edits
  (`update`/`prune`/`splice`), introspection (`params_table`,
  `build_priors`, `event`/`event_names`/`event_tree`), moments, and the
  convolution bridge (`observed_distribution`, `convolve_distributions`).
- Added `Varying` / `Context` / `instantiate`: leaves whose distribution
  depends on an observed covariate (time, stratum), resolved by
  `instantiate(tree, ctx)`; `has_varying(tree)` guards fitting loops.
- `Resolve`/`Compete` outcome probabilities read via `Distributions.probs`
  (following the CensoredDistributions rename).
- Docs site (overview, concepts, three tutorials, FAQ, interface
  contracts), benchmarks (core + AD) with a docs page, and a Mooncake AD
  extension.

- Added `uncertain` / `Uncertain`: leaf distributions whose parameters are
  themselves distributions, nestable to any depth. `rand` draws the marginal so
  uncertain leaves compose everywhere, and the rest of the univariate surface
  (scalar `logpdf`/`cdf`/..., the moments, including a composed tree's overall
  moment) delegates to the template's central values. `has_uncertain(tree)`
  flags a tree that still holds an uncertain leaf, for a scoring/fitting loop
  to guard against a forgotten collapse. Collapse an uncertain leaf to its
  concrete template by pinning the parameters with `update(tree, params)`.
  Build one with a concrete template
  (`uncertain(Gamma(2.0, 1.0); shape = LogNormal(...))`), a positional family
  form (`uncertain(Gamma, LogNormal(...), 1.0)`), or the keyword family form.
  `truncated(uncertain(...))` pushes inside the template (conditional
  per-draw semantics). `params_table` gained a `prior` column carrying an
  uncertain parameter's spec, which `build_priors` now uses ahead of its
  per-row default.
